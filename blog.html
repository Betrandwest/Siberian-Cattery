                <h2>Siberian Kittens - Siberian kitten </h2>

                <h4>SIBERIAN CAT HYPO-ALLERGENIC CATS:</h4> <p>After breeding Siberians Kittens and cats since 1994 and having many families visiting my home, I can now say with confidence that people with cat allergies can tolerate the Siberian kitten. This, of
                    course, cannot be a 100% guarantee but many are living with a Siberian. I myself am allergic to cats and I have no problem with them. Siberian Cat Breeders have found that the Siberian Cat has reduced cat allergens called FEL D1. This
                    allergen is extremely potent. Secretions from the glands of the skin are the primary source of FEL D1, but it is also deposited on the fur through the saliva when they clean themselves. Eventually, the allergen flakes off and becomes
                    airborne to trigger the symptoms that characterize allergies to cats. Feline allergen levels vary within the Siberian Cat breed, and human reactions to this allergen vary considerably. Please remember, the term hypoallergenic means
                    “causes less allergic response”. Just through many years of experience, I have placed Siberian Kittens in homes of people who have never been able to own a cat before!! If possible it is best to visit a Siberian Kittens For Sale in
                    person.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Multiple studies have shown neutering sharply reduces Fel-d1 levels and allergic reactions. The allergen is hormonally controlled, and non-neutered males produce the highest levels. After neutering, allergen levels drop sharply in both
                    males and females. We recommend early neutering with your Veterinarian’s advice in households with cat allergies. Many years ago Croshka Siberian Kittens started taking samples of saliva for testing Fel-d1 allergen levels from our
                    adult breeding Siberian cCats. These samples were sent to Indoor Biotechnologies, which specializes in measuring Fel-d1 allergens. Much to our pleasant surprise, a large majority of my cat line showed very low allergen levels!!!! The
                    sex or color of the cat didn’t seem to matter with these cats tested. Since the testing, we have found the unscientific method of witnessing all of the families living with Siberians Kittens .This test has been the best test around!!</p>
                <br>
                <h4>SIBERIAN KITTEN APPEARANCE</h4> <p>The Siberian cat is a medium to large cat with the overall appearance of excellent physical condition, strength, balance, power, and alertness, modified by a sweet facial expression. Sibeiran Kittens can come
                    in a rainbow of Russian colors since they are a natural breed. Female cats can average 8-13 lbs, while males average 10-18 lbs, with some being larger. Males do become much more muscular than females. Siberian Forest Cat are slow to
                    mature and take up to five years to fully develop. Their eyes vary in color from gold to green and all shades in between and colorpoints will always have blue eyes. Siberians are a natural breed and reflect the climate in which they
                    developed, with their very dense, medium to long, water repellent triple coat. This coat is accented with a ruff around the neck, full fluffy britches, and a bushy tail, normally carried up with pride. Lynx tipping on the ear is allowed,
                    and full ear furnishings are required. This means that the tops of the ears can have hair, which makes the ears look pointed when in fact they are rounded, and that the inside of the ear has hair that protects it from the elements.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Male vs. Female Behavior Findings:</h4>
                <p>In the book “The Cat’s Mind” by Dr. Bruce Fogle, a survey had been done with over 100 small animal Veterinarians. He was trying to determine the different behavior in males and females and neutered male and female cats. This was a “forced evaluation”
                survey. The survey determined that NEUTERED MALES AND FEMALES SHOWED MINIMAL DIFFERENCES IN BEHAVIOR. Neutered males are very slightly friendlier to other household cats and are slightly easier to handle and give a little more affection
                than females. There is no difference in their demand for attention, hygiene, level of activity, destructiveness, use of voice, excitability or playfulness. Both male and female cats can spray when not spayed or neutered. Whereas the difference
                in behavior between male and female dogs are still major differences after neutering, this is not true with cats. There is some evidence that as far as friendliness to other cats, handling and giving affection, NEUTERED MALES ACTUALLY
                MAKE EASIER PETS THAN Spayed FEMALES. Size Issue: Female cats average 8-13 lbs, males average 10-18 lbs, with some being larger. Males do become much more muscular than females. Siberians are slow to mature and take up to five years to
                fully develop.</p>
                <h4>SIBERIAN CAT PERSONALITY:</h4>
                <p>The Siberians have a wonderful dog like purrrrrrrsonality and they are very affectionate and ca even leare ad love to play fetch!!! Unlike many breeds, this breed will come over and greet a stranger. They are very intelligent and learn quickly and even
                “problem-solve” to get what they want. They love to be spoken to and will come running if called by name. Siberians also have a triple purr and unlike other breeds have a chirping sound when coming up to greet you. They also have a large
                bushy tail that stands at attention and does a shimmering effect when happy. Siberians have a fascination with water, often dropping toys into their water dishes or investigating bathtubs before they dry. This is the ideal lap cat that
                is calm and yet very active at playtime.</p>

                <h4>KITTENS​</h4>
                <p>Our Siberian Kittens Cattery has received lots of love and will seduce you as much by his endearing and affectionate behavior as by his legendary beauty! Suppose you are looking for a high-quality Siberian Kittens for sale that stands out. In that case,
                Siberian Kittens Cattery is the right choice for you.</p>

                <h4>SIBERIAN KITTEN TEMPERAMENT</h4>
                <p>The temperament of the Siberian Kittens you are going to buy is of the utmost importance because that will determine your bond, attachment, and love for him. For a Siberian cat to be kind and affectionate, he must have been socialized and cuddled from
                an early age. The first months at the cattery are very important. At Siberian Kittens Cattery, our short legs Sausage cat are born and grow in the heart of our living room. They get much love and are petted throughout the day, so they
                are wonderfully socialized, as you can imagine. Our Siberian kittens for sale are adorable. And since the temperament is often hereditary, we select Siberian cats with the best possible personality, which makes all the difference.</p>

                around the world to join their new families.</p>

                <h4>SIBERIAN KITTEN HEALTH</h4>
                <p>All of our breeding Siberian cats undergo a series of health tests to screen for various possible hereditary diseases, including HCM (heart), by a specialized cardiologist. These measures avoid many problems for our cats, our Siberian Kittens for sale,
                and their future owners.</p>
