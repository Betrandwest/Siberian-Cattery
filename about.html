                    my husband and I started in Russia when we met as friends, at a well-known Siberian cat cattery (I prefer not to mention the name) to learn about this fascinating breed of Siberian forest cat and its coat, which is a hypoallergenic
                    cat. We ended up becoming more than friends, not just because of feelings, but because we had a love for something in common. Then we decided to move to the United States and start a Siberian cat breeding business and call ourselves
                    Chloe's Siberian Cat Breeders. We do shows for the community. Our shows are not meant to make us popular, famous or even make money. It is to show the community how well cared for our Siberian kittens for sale are, when it comes to
                    home breeding, and to educate many people about Siberians. Although we sometimes have small breeders join us at some of our shows to show their love for their breed as well, there are many ongoing genetic studies that may lead to a
                    broader understanding of the coat variations in these Siberian kittens. Although for now Siberian cat admirers and breeders can rest assured that this cat (Siberian) is among the most unique in the world Siberian kittens for sale.
                    In 2005, Siberian kittens were accepted into the International Cat Association and also into championship competitions. Further research will help to understand more about the Siberian kitten breed, especially its hypoallergenic feline
                    nature. It is very important to know and consider the complexities of cat breed allergies before bringing them into your home.</p>

                    <h3>SIBERIAN KITTEN VACCINATION</h3>
                    <p>Our kittens for sale are vaccinated at 5 and 10 weeks. Weeks of life with Heska Two way FVRC Ultra Nasal Vaccine and at 12 weeks of age with Heska Three way FVRCP Ultra Nasal Vaccine. And we believe these are the only medications that should be given
                    to any Siberian kitten unless the Siberian kitten is infected.</p>

                    <h3>SIBERIAN KITTEN GROOMING.</h3>
                    <p>Our Siberian cats for sale are hand trained. Siberian cats are known for their thick coats and hypoallergenic cat nature, Grooming a Siberian kitten is easier than most long haired cats, Grooming can be done once or twice a week to keep the Siberian kitten
                    healthy, Dandruff on Siberian kittens is done twice a year. Our hypoallergenic cats for sale are well fed.</p>

                    <h3>OUR HYPOALLERGENIC CATS FOR SALE.</h3>
                    <p>Prepare your home for hypoallergenic cats. Purchase a scratching post, litter box, food and water bowls, and cat bed before bringing your cat home. Make sure the litter box is placed in a quiet, low-traffic area - such as a pantry, guest bathroom or other
                    out-of-the-way corner - where the hypoallergenic cat can defecate in peace. Buy a large Siberian cat carrier, as our Siberian cat for sale can get quite large. It is okay if the carrier seems too large at first; the cat will get used
                    to it. When you bring the hypoallergenic cat home, place the carrier in a room, open the door of the Siberian cat carrier and close the door to the room. Let the cat explore the room at its leisure. Give the Siberian cat room to explore.
                    Our Siberian cats for sale have a high energy level and like to roam. Most prefer to have access to the outdoors. If kept indoors, they should have at least one large apartment to explore. Hypoallergenic apartment cats for sale are
                    at risk for obesity due to their lower activity levels, so watch their food intake carefully. Outdoor cats are at increased risk of injury and illness. Therefore, do not allow them to roam freely in areas where they may come into contact
                    with heavy vehicle traffic, wild animals, or pesticides and other chemicals. Siberian kittens are strong jumpers and like to explore high places. They are nimble cats and don't tend to break things, but you may want to consider keeping
                    valuable or expensive items out of their reach. Provide entertainment. Our Siberian cats for sale are intelligent and need stimulation. Bored Siberian cats can overeat, scratch at furniture, and here are some ways to prevent boredom:
                    Buy a ceiling-high "tree" that Siberian kittens for sale can jump up to inspect their territory. Give Siberian kittens cat toys and puzzles. Experiment with yarn, toy mice, laser pointers and catnip. Many Siberian cats enjoy playing
                    fetch. Encourage it with treats or dry food as rewards. A second Siberian cat often makes the first cat feel less lonely, especially if they are littermates. Make sure the cats are spayed or neutered unless you want to mess with kittens;
                    this is especially important if you have a male and female Siberian kitten together, but outdoor cats may also encounter cats of the opposite sex in your neighborhood How to keep your cat healthy Maintain your cat's coat. Although
                    Siberian cats have thick coats, grooming is easier than with most long-haired cats. Siberian cats' coats don't tend to mat too quickly, so grooming them once or twice a week is enough to keep them healthy. Brush gently with a soft,
                    smooth brush. Siberians molt twice a year and shed their fur in large clumps. During this time, daily brushing is the easiest way to keep the coat from matting and tangling. Brushing reduces the likelihood of hairballs. Protect the
                    cat from heat. Do not keep Siberian cats in temperatures above 33ºC (91ºF). They are adapted to cold climates, and they can overheat easily in their thick coats. Take the following precautions during summer months: Put ice in the cat's
                    food or water. At the very least, use cold water instead of warm or room-temperature water. Take the cat to a professional groomer and have her shave away most of the fur. The fur will grow back by the winter, but it may make your
                    cat much more comfortable through the summer months. Visit a veterinarian if your cat seems uncomfortable. You may notice it going to great lengths to keep cool, such as rubbing against the refrigerator or spending time in cold spaces.
                    If the cat makes painful yowling noises, and it doesn't seem particularly hungry, it might be uncomfortable. Bathe the cat occasionally. Siberian cats have a water-resistant, triple-layered coat. Many of them enjoy water and may try
                    to jump into the bath or shower. Even if your cat doesn't like water, give him a bath whenever his coat gets dirty. Bathing can also reduce allergens if someone in the house is allergic to cats. If necessary, use a mild cat shampoo
                    and conditioner made with oatmeal. Your Siberian cat has a fairly oily coat, which keeps the skin healthy and regulates the cat's temperature. Bathing too often can remove these protective oils. Because of the thick coat, it can take
                    up to 45 minutes for your cat's fur to get completely wet. Check your cat's health weekly. If you have a kitten, start early with these grooming routines so she can get used to them. If you have difficulty with these procedures, ask
                    a veterinarian to show you how to do them: Trim the nails once a week or as needed. Use scissors to trim the nails. Check your cat's ears about once a week. If they appear dirty, clean them with a cotton swab moistened with a mild
                    cat ear cleaner recommended by your veterinarian. If the ears are red or smell bad, take your cat to the veterinarian. Brush your cat's teeth regularly with a veterinarian-recommended toothpaste to ensure good health and fresh breath.
                    Siberian cats can pick up ticks or fleas quite easily. Check outdoor cats regularly and remove ticks and fleas if found. Schedule regular veterinary checkups. Siberian cats are prone to stomach problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome
                    or lymphoma. Visit the veterinarian regularly to keep an eye on their stomach. Siberians are also prone to at least one hereditary health problem: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Siberians to be bred should be screened for HCM, and cats
                    identified with HCM should be removed from breeding programs. Do not purchase kittens whose parents have not been tested for this disease. Feed cats high-quality food. Foods can cause higher or lower levels of allergens. High-quality
                    food can also prevent many health problems in cats. Feed only the amounts recommended by your veterinarian, keeping treat consumption in mind. Keeping a Siberian cat at the proper weight is one of the easiest ways to protect its overall
                    health. If your cat is overweight, dieting may be necessary.</p>

                    <p>Insurance for purebred Siberian cats costs more than insurance for mixed breed Siberian cats. This is because a purebred Siberian cat is more likely than a mixed breed Siberian cat to file claims for hereditary diseases, which are expensive to treat.
                    We include pet insurance plans for our Siberian cats for sale, and provide full coverage for all Siberian kittens for the adoption-specific conditions (except those already present) to which purebred Siberian cats are prone. The best
                    time to purchase insurance for your Siberian cat is when it is a healthy Siberian kitten. You can't predict what will happen in the future, and pet insurance is the one thing you can't have when you need it most. Siberian kitten health
